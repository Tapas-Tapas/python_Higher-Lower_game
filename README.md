Game Rules
##########
The game starts by displaying two random players: one from cricket and one from football.
You need to guess who has more followers by typing 'A' for the cricket player or 'B' for the football player.
If your guess is correct, you score a point, and the game continues with new players.
If your guess is incorrect, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
